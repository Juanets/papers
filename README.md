# Papers
A collection of useful articles and research papers about data science.

### 1. [A Machine Learning Framework to Identify Students at Risk of Adverse Academic Outcomes](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/montogmery-kd2015.pdf)
  * Comparison of multiple algorithms (logistic regression, random forests, SVMs and others)
  * Evaluation of said algorithms using ROC curves, precision/recall, empirical risk
  * Finding similarities between outputs using Jaccard similarity metric
  * Identifying mistake patterns (e.g. high GPA/high absence rate or low GPA/low absence rate)
### 2. [Discovering Types for Entity Disambiguation](https://blog.openai.com/discovering-types-for-entity-disambiguation/)
  * Training a neural network to understand the context of a word (e.g. "Jaguar" > the car? the animal?)
  * Understanding the context of *X* word based on surroundings of original text + Wikipedia's categories and links
  * Interesting data-gathering schema, using Wikidata's knowledge graphs
### 3. [Applied Machine Learning at Facebook: A Datacenter Infrastructure Perspective](https://research.fb.com/publications/applied-machine-learning-at-facebook-a-datacenter-infrastructure-perspective/)
  * An approach to deploying machine learning and deep learning models in real-time
  * Insightful descriptions of Facebook's workflow: data > training algorithms > deployment / research
  * Very interesting details about Facebook's algorithms (Lumos, Facer, News Feed...)
